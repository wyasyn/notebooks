## Introduction

Machine learning models are used to make predictions, but how do we know if they are doing a good job? Just like how we measure a student's performance using test scores, we have different ways to measure the success of a machine learning model. These measurements are called **performance metrics**.

In this blog, we'll break down key performance metrics into simple, easy-to-understand explanations, so you don't need to be a tech expert to get the idea!

## Metrics for Predicting Numbers (Regression Models)

Imagine you're trying to predict house prices based on factors like size and location. The actual price might be $100,000, but your model predicts $95,000. How do we measure how close or far off these predictions are?

### 1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

Think of this as the average mistake your model makes. If MAE is $5,000, it means, on average, your model's predictions are $5,000 off from the actual prices.

**Formula:**
$$ MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}\_i| $$

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
print("MAE:", mae)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Lower MAE = Better predictions**

### 2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

This metric is like MAE but with a twist: It squares the errors before averaging them. This means that big mistakes are penalized more than small ones.

**Formula:**
$$ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}\_i)^2 $$

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
print("MSE:", mse)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Smaller MSE = Fewer large mistakes**

### 3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

RMSE is just the square root of MSE. It also punishes big mistakes but brings the final number back to the original unit (like dollars instead of squared dollars).

**Formula:**
$$ RMSE = \sqrt{MSE} $$

**Python Code:**

```python
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred, squared=False)
print("RMSE:", rmse)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Lower RMSE = Better accuracy with a focus on big mistakes**

### 4. **R-squared (RÂ² Score)**

This tells us how well the model explains the data. If RÂ² is 0.90, it means 90% of the changes in house prices can be explained by the model.

**Formula:**
$$ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS*{res}}{SS*{tot}} $$

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
print("RÂ² Score:", r2)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Higher RÂ² (closer to 1) = Model is doing a good job**

## Metrics for Categorizing Things (Classification Models)

Now, imagine youâ€™re designing a model to detect whether an email is **spam** or **not spam**. How do we measure if the model is working well?

### 1. **Accuracy**

This is the simplest metricâ€”what percentage of predictions were correct?

**Formula:**
$$ Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} $$

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Higher accuracy = More correct predictions**

### 2. **Precision**

Precision focuses on how many of the emails predicted as **spam** were actually **spam**.

**Formula:**
$$ Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} $$

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
print("Precision:", precision)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **High precision = Fewer false alarms**

### 3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**

Recall measures how many of the actual spam emails were caught by the model.

**Formula:**
$$ Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
print("Recall:", recall)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **High recall = Model catches more spam emails**

### 4. **F1 Score**

F1 Score balances **precision** and **recall**.

**Formula:**
$$ F1 = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall} $$

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
print("F1 Score:", f1)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Higher F1 Score = Better balance between precision and recall**

### 5. **Confusion Matrix**

A confusion matrix is like a report card for the model.

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Lower false positives and false negatives = Better performance**

### 6. **ROC Curve & AUC Score**

This is a fancy way to check how well the model separates spam from non-spam emails.

**Python Code:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred_prob)
print("AUC Score:", auc)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Higher AUC (closer to 1) = Better model**

## Conclusion

Performance metrics help us understand how well a machine learning model is working. The choice of metric depends on what we are trying to achieve:
âœ… If predicting **numbers**, focus on **MAE, MSE, RMSE, or RÂ²**.
âœ… If classifying **categories**, use **accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, confusion matrix, and AUC**.

The key is to pick the right metric for the right job. Hopefully, this guide makes machine learning metrics a little less intimidating!
