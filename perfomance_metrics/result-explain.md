# These metrics help you evaluate the performance of your logistic regression model:

1. **Accuracy (0.8)** – This means that 80% of the total predictions your model made were correct. However, accuracy alone may not be enough, especially if your dataset is imbalanced.

2. **Precision (0.9)** – Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. A precision of 0.9 (or 90%) means that when your model predicts a positive class, it is correct 90% of the time.

3. **Recall (0.4)** – Recall (also called Sensitivity) measures how well your model identifies actual positive cases. A recall of 0.4 (or 40%) means your model only identifies 40% of all actual positive cases, missing 60% of them.

4. **F1-score (0.6)** – The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances both metrics, and a score of 0.6 suggests that your model is not capturing positive cases very well (low recall) despite being precise when it does predict a positive case.

### What This Means

- Your model is good at avoiding false positives (high precision) but struggles to detect all true positives (low recall).
- If missing positive cases is a problem (e.g., in medical diagnoses or fraud detection), you should try to improve recall.
- Possible improvements:
  - Adjust the decision threshold.
  - Use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting if your data is imbalanced.
  - Try a more complex model or feature engineering.
