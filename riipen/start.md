This is a well-structured project, and I can definitely help you build it step by step. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

### **Step 1: Define the Scope & Gather Requirements**

- Have you confirmed the key requirements with Aurora Organics?
- Do you have access to a reliable **skin image dataset**?
- Are there specific skincare recommendations that need to be linked to each detected skin condition?

### **Step 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing**

- We need high-quality datasets of skin conditions. Some options include:
  - **Public Datasets:** DermNet, ISIC Archive, HAM10000
  - **Custom Data:** Collecting images from Aurora Organics' users/customers
- Preprocessing:
  - Image **resizing, normalization, augmentation**
  - **Labeling skin conditions** for supervised learning

### **Step 3: Build the Computer Vision Model**

- Framework: **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch**
- Model: **CNN-based classification (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet)**
- Train the model on **labeled skin images**
- Validate performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**

### **Step 4: Build the Predictive Model**

- After detecting skin issues, we need a simple recommendation system.
- Techniques:
  - **Rule-based system** (if-condition mappings)
  - **ML-based system** (train on historical skincare data)

### **Step 5: Develop the Interactive Dashboard**

- Backend: **FastAPI/Django**
- Frontend: **React.js or Next.js**
- Visualization: **Power BI / Tableau / Dash**
- Users should see:
  - Detected skin conditions
  - Recommended skincare solutions
  - Model performance metrics

### **Step 6: Testing & Deployment**

- **Test the model** with real images
- **Optimize for speed & accuracy**
- **Deploy as a web app or API**

#### **Questions for You:**

1. Do you have a preferred tech stack for the backend/frontend?
2. Are you planning a **web app, mobile app, or both**?
3. Would you like to start with **data collection & preprocessing**, or should we prototype the AI model first?

Let me know how youâ€™d like to proceed, and I can provide code snippets, dataset recommendations, or architectural guidance! ðŸš€
