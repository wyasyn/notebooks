For your client meeting, youâ€™ll want to gather as much detailed information as possible to ensure the project aligns with their expectations. Below are key questions categorized into different aspects of the project.

---

### **1. Business & Project Goals**

- What is the primary objective of the AI-powered Skin Analyzer?
- How do you envision users interacting with this system?
- What are the most important success criteria (e.g., accuracy, speed, user engagement)?
- Are there any existing solutions or competitors that you want to benchmark against?

---

### **2. Data Collection & Sources**

- Do you have a dataset of skin images, or will we need to source publicly available datasets?
- Will users be uploading images, or will the system need to take real-time photos?
- How do you handle user data privacy and compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?

---

### **3. Skin Analysis & Recommendations**

- What skin conditions should the system detect? (e.g., acne, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, dryness)
- Do you have a dermatologist or expert providing skincare recommendations, or should we generate recommendations based on existing product databases?
- Should recommendations be **generic** or linked to **specific products** sold by Aurora Organics?

---

### **4. Technical & Functional Requirements**

- What is the expected platform? (Web app, mobile app, both?)
- What level of accuracy do you expect from the AI model?
- Should the system operate **in real-time** or process images asynchronously?
- Should we integrate third-party AI tools (e.g., Google Vision, AWS Rekognition), or do you prefer a fully custom-built AI model?

---

### **5. User Experience & Design**

- What type of user interface do you prefer? (Minimalist, interactive, data-rich?)
- Should the dashboard be available to all users or only to admins and professionals?
- Do you want the system to offer **progress tracking** (e.g., users can compare before/after images over time)?

---

### **6. Deployment & Integration**

- Where will this solution be hosted? (Cloud, on-premises, or hybrid?)
- Should this system integrate with your existing Aurora Organics website or app?
- Will there be future phases for AI improvement and feature expansion?

---

### **7. Budget & Timeline**

- What is your expected project budget? (To determine whether to use cloud AI services or custom-built models)
- What is your ideal project timeline?
- Do you have internal developers who will maintain the system, or will external support be needed?

---

### **8. Compliance & Security**

- Do you have specific data security concerns (e.g., image storage, encryption)?
- Should we implement **user authentication** (e.g., login required) or allow anonymous usage?
- Do you need legal agreements (e.g., Terms of Service, Privacy Policy) for AI-based skin analysis?

---

### **Final Step: Setting Expectations**

- How often would you like progress updates? (Weekly, bi-weekly?)
- Who are the key stakeholders we should report to?
- What are your biggest concerns or risks for this project?

---

### **Next Steps After the Meeting**

After gathering the responses, we can:  
âœ… Refine the project scope and deliverables  
âœ… Select the best datasets and AI model approach  
âœ… Design the system architecture based on their preferences

Let me know how the meeting goes! Once you have the clientâ€™s answers, we can start building. ðŸš€
